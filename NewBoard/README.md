This is the main project a of the solution, a web application to discover/subscribe/consult feeds from any website.

## Tech side

The app is a dotnet.core 1.1 web application.
It works as a single page application using only jquery and bootstrap.
The SPA framework is homemade, the principle is to send commands and response between client/server the server handles the rendering and tells what to do with the reponse.
